I am not sure if this question has been asked, but i have looked around and did not find anything specific to my problem. I am trying to build an App to search though all dirs and sub dirs for specific files by there ext(.txt, .mkv, .mp3) mostly these extention will be used (if it matters) I would like the program to display the findings in a text area(text field of sort) to show file name and path.

I have a script that i am working with but i'm not sure if it is the best way to go about it. So my question is how do i binde the existing script to the button widget. i think? there could be more. again still learning.

If there is an easier way(less steps = cleaner code) please "show me the code" Documentation is always helpful but a "hands on" method works best for me. I am still learning Python and Tkinter now. This is not the complete code. i have removed everything that was not working for me so very incomplete.
from tkinter import *
from tkinter import ttk
from sys import argv
import glob
import os

search_input = argv
#code in question
def find_files():
    for dirname, dirnames, filenames in os.walk('/home'):
        for i in glob.glob('/*'+searchinput):
            listbox.insert(END, search_input)

#Code in question

main = Tk()
main.title("FSX")
main.geometry('640x480')

frame1 = ttk.Frame(main, height=200, width=400)
frame1.pack()

entry = Entry(frame1, width=30)
entry.pack()

button1 = ttk.Button(frame1, text="Search", command=find_files)
button1.pack()
button1.bind ('<ButtonPress>', lambda e: progressbar.start())

button2 = ttk.Button(frame1, text="Quit")
button2.pack()
button2.bind ('<ButtonPress>', lambda e: exit())

progressbar = ttk.Progressbar(frame1, orient = HORIZONTAL, length = 200,      mode = 'indeterminate')
progressbar.pack()
#progressbar.start()

frame2 = ttk.Frame(main, height=200, width=400)
frame2.pack()

listbox = Listbox(frame2, height=200, width=400)
listbox.pack(fill=BOTH, expand=YES)

progressbar.stop()

main.mainloop()
